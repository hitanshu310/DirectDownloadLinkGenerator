# DirectDownloadLinkGenerator
Takes publicly shareable drive links in a text file and gives direct download links to be embedded.

** Currently the tool works only for images
** For the tool to work, the links should be publicly accessible to anyone on the web, to get to this setting some settings will have to be changed to attain this.
** Place the links in input.txt file in new lines and output will be in output.txt on new lines.
